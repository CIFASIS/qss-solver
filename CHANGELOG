## Changelog

## [4.0.1] - 03-11-2022

### Added
- Compilation **Ubuntu 22.04** is now supported.
- Use State variables values instead of quantized approximation in handler reinit statements for QSS methods.

### Changed
- The QSS methods event structure **SD_EventData** now contains a new matrix that defines the RHS state variables not used in LHS state assignments. 

### Removed
- Gtest lib compilation, the compiled libraries are distributed now.

### Added
- **N-Dimensional** Arrays are supported.
- New algorithms were developed to compute all dependency matrices that use the [**SB--Graph**](https://github.com/CIFASIS/sb-graph) interface.
- Allow discrete variable update in the form: (a,b,c) = f(d,f,g) in event handlers.
- New **MMO_RandomSeed** annotation that sets the seed used in all functions from the `math` package.
- Allow user defined dependency matrix entries.
- Allow dense matrix generation in **LIQSS_BDF** hybrid method (useful for testing).

### Changed
- All variables defined in the model instance generated by the MicroModelica C Compiler are now described in terms of macro definitions. 

### Removed
- Support for Mac and Windows.
- Support for rpm packages.
- 3rd party Scotch and Ginac libraries, system installed libraries are used now.
