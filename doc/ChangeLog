3.1.1 (2016-10-06)
------------------

New
~~~

- New message processing policy, discard incoming messages until the
  first message for that variable is consumed.

- Implmeneted default simulation strategy for adaptive algorithm and
  purely discrete communication.

- Discrete variable output for parallel simulations.

- Generate weights for parallel graphs directly from parallel
  simulations.

- Added graph profiling data structures to engine and compiler projects.

- DD communication matrix implementation for parallel simulations.

- Allow simulatenous steps in parallel simulations.

Changes
~~~~~~~

- Alloc discrete vector for DH matrix in parallel simulations when no
  output variables are defined.

- Added links to porject documentation in the GUI.

- Fixed GUI typos and names.

- Disable symbolic differentiation only if there's UDF in the equation
  section or in the zero--crossing function definitions.

- Abort parallel simul√±ation if a wrong partition is      detected.

- Don't use symbolic differentiation if not set.

- Read integer values for dt parameter in settings file.

- Disable compiler graph generation when is not needed.

- Don't show dat files diff when running tests.

Fix
~~~

- Don't update the dt value when an LP finishes if FIXED strategy is
  used.

- Wrong for range in generic equation definition.

- Get the correct intersection of two indexes defined in the same range.

- Incidence matrices offset in generic definitions.

- Write structural matrix dependencies using always the influenced
  index.

- Fixed parallel simulation memory leaks.
