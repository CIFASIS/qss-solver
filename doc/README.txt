QSS Solver 3.1
--------------

Description
----------.

The QSS Solver is a modeling and simulation environment for 
continuous and hybrid systems.

Models are described using a subset of the Modelica language 
called MicroMoledica (http://www.fceia.unr.edu.ar/
control/modelica/micromodelicaspec.pdf).

Simulations can be performed using one of the following integration methods:

	* QSS methods (the entire family is supported)
	* DASSL
	* DOPRI

New Features
------------

	* Parallel simulation is supported for Linux platform.

	* Modelica User Defined Functions (UDF) are now supported (including external C functions).
	
	* The Modelica Package class containing UDF's is now supported.
	
	* 'for' statements can be used in "event handler" definitions, i.e. inside 'when' and
	  'elsewhen' statements.
	
	* Modelica array element-wise operations are supported (.+,.-,.*,./).
	
	* Modelica reduction operations for arrays are supported:
			- sum
			- product
			- min
			- max
			- *
	
	* Classic numerical integration methods DASSL and DOPRI can be used to run simulations.
