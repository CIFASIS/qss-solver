/**
 * \brief Representation of geometrical 3D volumes
 *
 * A \em volume is a 3D object that conforms the geometry throughout which
 * particles navigate along a retQSS simulation. A geometry is typically
 * composed of two different kinds of volumes: \em polyhedral \em volumes
 * (retQSS::PolyhedralVolume), supported by 3D convex polyhedrons, and a
 * single \em open \em volume, (retQSS::OpenVolume), which represents the
 * exterior of the tessellated 3D mesh conformed by these polyhedral
 * volumes.
 *
 * A volume is aware of its neighboring adjacent volumes, which are
 * those that share common logical faces (retQSS::LogicalFace). When a particle
 * crosses a volume boundary, the corresponding adjacent volume is retrieved
 * so that the particle state is updated.
 *
 * \paragraph Queries Intersection and distance queries
 *
 * Intersection (with directed linear rays) and distance queries with volumes
 * are supported by an underlying AABB tree data structure (retQSS::AABBTree).
 * This tree varies according to the type of the volume: for polyhedral
 * volumes, every face stored in the tree belongs to the same underlying
 * polyhedron, whereas an open volume spans faces from several polyhedrons
 * --those that are on the geometry boundary.
