 * geometrical object in retQSS: volumes, faces and vertices. A unique
 * instance of this class is created by the retQSS interface
 * (retQSS::Interface) and initialized by the geometry
 * parser (retQSS::GeometryParser) when instructed by the user (e.g. by
 * calling the model API method retQSS_geometry_setUp). After this, the
 * retQSS interface keeps an internal reference to the geometry and
 * delegates to it every geometry-related query.
