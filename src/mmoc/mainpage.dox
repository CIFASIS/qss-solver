/** 
 *   @mainpage MicroModelica Compiler Developer's Guide
 *
 * @section intro Introduction
 * The MicroModelica compiler allows the user to describe models 
 * using a subset of the standard Modelica language called μ–Modelica 
 * (the language specification can be found in 
 * http://www.cifasis-conicet.gov.ar/jfernandez/micromodelica/micromodelicaspec.pdf), 
 * the compiler extracts all the structural information needed and
 * automatically generates the plain C code that contains an appropiate 
 * model definition needed by the 
 * QSS Solver engine (https://github.com/CIFASIS/qss-solver)
 * together with all the configuration files (makefiles, config, etc.).
 * 
 * @section install Installation
 * 
 * These are generic installation instructions.
 *
 * @subsection deps Dependencies
 *
 * In order to be able to install and compile the QSS Solver, 
 * the following dependencies must be installed: 
 *  
 *  - bison++ 
 *  - g++
 *  - libcln-dev
 *   
 * @subsection inst Basic Intallation
 *
 * The simplest way to compile this package is:
 *
 *  1.`cd' to the directory containing the compiler source code and type
 *    `make '. The mmoc binary is located in the usr/bin folder.
 *   
 *  2.You can remove the generated binaries and object files from the
 *    source code directory by typing `make clean'.  
 * 
 * @subsection mkopt Makefile Options 
 *
 * The makefile script accepts the following options:
 *
 *   - MODE = <Debug|Release>  If set to Debug, adds the compiler's debug flags. 
 *             Default value Debug.
 *   
 *
 * @subsection mktgs Makefile targets
 *
 * The makefile script accepts the following targets:
 *   
 *   - default:  Builds the MicroModelica compiler.
 *   - doc:      Builds the compiler documentation.
 *   - clean:    Clean up generated files.
