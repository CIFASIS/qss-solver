MicroModelica Compiler 3.2
--------------------------

The MicroModelica compiler allows the user to describe models 
using a subset of the standard Modelica language called μ–Modelica 
(the language specification can be found in 
http://www.cifasis-conicet.gov.ar/jfernandez/micromodelica/micromodelicaspec.pdf), 
the compiler extracts all the structural information needed and
automatically generates the plain C code that contains an appropiate 
model definition needed by the 
QSS Solver engine (https://github.com/CIFASIS/qss-solver-engine)
together with all the configuration files (makefiles, config, etc.).
The compiler documentation can be found at:
