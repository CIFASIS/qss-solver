QSS Solver GUI 3.2
--------------

The QSS Solver GUI is a simple interface that allows the end-user
of the QSS Solver to access all the developed tools in a
unified way.

The GUI has the following features:

  * It has a text editor, where models in Î¼-Modelica can be defined.
  * It invokes the corresponding tools to compile and run simulations.
  * It provides debug information in case of errors during the model generation.
  * It invokes GnuPlot to plot the simulation output trajectories.
  * It shows statistics about simulations (number of steps, simulation time,
etc.).
