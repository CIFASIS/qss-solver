Installation
============

These are generic installation instructions.

Basic Installation
==================

The simplest way to compile the source code is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the user libraries source code and type
     `make '. The generated libraries are located in the usr/lib folder.
     
  2. You can remove the generated binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  

Makefile options
================

The makefile script accepts the following options:

    * DEBUG = <True|False>  If True, adds the compiler's debug flags. 
              Default value False.
    
    * ENGINE= Path to the QSS Solver engine source code root folder. 
              Default value ".".

Makefile targets
================

The makefile script accepts the following targets:
    
    * default:  Builds the user libraries.
    * clean:    Clean up generated files.
