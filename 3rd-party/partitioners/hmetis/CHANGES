1.5.3
  - Fixed some bugs introduced with 1.5.1
  - Added an option in khmetis and HMETIS_PartKway to directly optimize 
    the sum of external degrees.

1.5.2
  - Fixed a bug related to the interface of HMETIS_PartRecursive 

1.5.1
  - Various run-time improvements (20% - 30% speedup).

1.5.0
  - Improved the quality of the multilevel k-way recursive bisection 
    algorithm. 
  - Added a new k-way partitioning code that is based on the multilevel
    k-way partitioning paradigm. It supports more meaningful balancing 
    constraints when k is relatively large. This is still an experimental
    feature.
  - Added support for partitioning with `fixed' vertices. The partitioning
    algorithm can now force user-specified sets of vertices to be placed to 
    user-specified partitions.

1.0.3
  - Improved support for hypergraphs with widely varying vertex weights

1.0.2
  - Fixed numerous problems related to fine-grain partitioning.
    This should eliminate most of the core dumps, especially for hypergraphs
    with no hyperedges.
  - Modified the I/O routines to handle hypergraphs with many large hyperedges

1.0.1
  - Added additional quality measures that are reported for k-way partitioning
