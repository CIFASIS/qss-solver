 *   @mainpage QSS Solver GUI Developer's Guide
 * 
 * @section intro Introduction
 * The QSS Solver GUI is a simple interface that allows the end-user
 * of the QSS Solver to access all the developed tools in a
 * unified way.
 *
 * The GUI has the following features:
 *
 * - It has a text editor, where models in Î¼-Modelica can be defined.
 * - It invokes the corresponding tools to compile and run simulations.
 * - It provides debug information in case of errors during the model generation.
 * - It invokes GnuPlot to plot the simulation output trajectories.
 * - It shows statistics about simulations (number of steps, simulation time, etc.).
 *
 * @section install Installation
 * 
 * These are generic installation instructions.
 *
 * @subsection deps Dependencies
 *
 * In order to be able to install and compile the QSS Solver, 
 * the following dependencies must be installed: 
 *  
 *  - gnuplot 
 *  - qt4-default (or higher)
 *   
 * @subsection inst Basic Intallation
 *
 * The simplest way to compile this package is:
 *
 *  1.`cd' to the directory containing the GUI source code and type
 *    `make -f gui.makefile'. 
 *    The qss-solver GUI executable is located in the usr/bin folder.
 *   
 *  2.You can remove the generated binaries and object files from the
 *    source code directory by typing `make clean'.  
 * 
 * @subsection mktgs Makefile targets
 *
 * The makefile script accepts the following targets:
 *   
 *   - default:  Builds the qss-solver GUI.
 *   - doc:      Builds the GUI documentation.
 *   - clean:    Clean up generated files.
